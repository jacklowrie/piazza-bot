# PiazzaBot
PiazzaBot is a simple slack bot that makes discussing posts on Piazza easier.
When a post is mentioned by ID, PiazzaBot will respond with a link to that
post.

is this bot.

## Contributing
Still thinking about the ideal workflow, however I'd like to keep PM on
GitHub for now. If you'd like to contribute, first of all, _thank you_!
Please first discuss the change you wish to make with the owners of this
repository, ideally via issue, before making a change or opening a pull request.
Take a look at the
[contribution guidelines ](https://github.com/jacklowrie/piazza-bot/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
for more.

## Development
PiazzaBot is built using [Slack's Bolt framework](https://github.com/SlackAPI/bolt-python).
As such, most developer documentation can be found there.
